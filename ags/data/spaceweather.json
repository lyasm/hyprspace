Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 32 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-11-11T09:08Z and 2023-11-11T21:22Z (average arrival 2023-11-11T15:43Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally, the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-11-11T11:35Z and 2023-11-12T00:18Z (average arrival 2023-11-11T18:24Z) for 100% of simulations.

The leading edge of the CME will reach OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-11-11T09:36Z, Psyche at 2023-11-11T22:29Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-11-11T05:44Z, and STEREO A at 2023-11-11T17:55Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20231109-AL-002).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-11-09_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA052/Detailed_results_20231109_122300_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA052.txt\n\n\n"},{"Type":"CME","name":"20231109-AL-002","date":"2023-11-09T21:30Z","note":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-APEX, Psyche, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-11-09T21:30:16Z\n## Message ID: 20231109-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Towards the end of the reporting period, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux crossed the 1000 pfu threshold at 2023-11-07T15:35Z (see notifications 20231107-AL-001 and 20231107-AL-002) due to the back-to-back arrivals of the C-type CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2023-11-02T03:36Z and 2023-11-03T05:48Z (previously described above) and a subsequent coronal hole high speed stream arrival detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE on 2023-11-06.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-11-01  06:07:00  06:49:00  06:26:00   M1.1   S15E80 ( 13477 ) \n2023-11-01  11:37:00  13:00:00  12:26:00   M1.4   S10E90 ( 13480 ) \n2023-11-02  12:18:00  12:26:00  12:22:00   M1.6   S18W35 ( 13474 ) \n2023-11-02  19:08:00  19:28:00  19:21:00   M1.0   S10E85 ( 13480 ) \n2023-11-05  11:34:00  11:47:00  11:43:00   M1.8   S09E52 ( 13480 ) \n2023-11-05  14:24:00  14:36:00  14:32:00   M1.6   S09E51 ( 13480 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-11-02T03:36Z     ~699            C               -20/35                35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-03T05:48Z     ~874            C                -3/21                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-11-02T19:48Z     ~611            C               -85/7                 17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-03T10:12Z     ~504            C               104/-38               41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-04T05:12Z     ~572            C                -3/60                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-05T16:53Z     ~735            C               -55/32                25                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-11-06T07:36Z     ~595            C                62/-30               36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-11-08T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-11-14T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently six numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing solar disk. Active Region 13480 (S08E02) produced three of the 6 M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to show similar level flaring activity during the outlook period. Active Region 13483 (N10W09) and Active Region 13477 (S15W22) may also exhibit C-level and possible M-class flaring activity during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. The large coronal hole structure that crossed the Earth-facing central meridian on 2023-11-04 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) reached geoeffective longitudes towards the end of the reporting period and is associated with a coronal hole high speed stream arrival detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE on 2023-11-06. Continued influences from this associated coronal hole high speed stream may be observed during the beginning of the outlook period. A smaller coronal hole centered near S30E20 is anticipated to cross the central meridian on or around 2023-11-10 and may become geoeffective towards the end of the outlook period on or around 2023-11-14. Additionally, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt currently remains enhanced (see notifications 20231107-AL-001 and 20231107-AL-002) and this elevated electron flux may persist into the beginning of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"Type":"RBE","name":"20231107-AL-002","date":"2023-11-07T16:52Z","note":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-11-07T16:52:41Z\n## Message ID: 20231107-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp=4.67 occurred during four synoptic periods. The value of Kp=4.67 occurring during the synoptic periods ending on 2023-10-26T12:00Z and 2023-10-27T00:00Z was likely caused by the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-10-26T03:43Z, which was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE on 2023-10-26. This interplanetary shock arrival may have also been detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data around 2023-10-26T11:10Z. Further enhancements in geomagnetic activity to Kp=4.67 occurred during the synoptic periods ending on 2023-10-29T03:00Z and 2023-10-29T09:00Z and was likely associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE on 2023-10-28. This coronal hole high speed stream arrival may have also been detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data on 2023-10-28. The solar wind speed reached values of around 550 km/s and 570 km/s, respectively. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-10-29T15:20Z (see notifications 20231029-AL-001 and 20231029-AL-002). Subsequently, towards the end of the reporting period, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux crossed the 1000 pfu threshold at 2023-10-31T12:50Z (see notification 20231031-AL-001). These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2023-10-28 described above. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above. \n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-10-26  22:47:00  00:20:00  23:24:00   M1.4   N20E90           \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-10-25T13:37Z     ~543            C               -90/-32               41                          SOHO                              \n2023-10-25T22:36Z     ~579            C                98/26                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-26T23:14Z     ~1024           O               -90/39                52                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-27T15:12Z     ~539            C            NONE(POS)/28             22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-30T00:42Z     ~567            C            NONE(POS)/49             46                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-31T21:12Z     ~603            C               -90/-1                43                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-31T22:12Z     ~717            C                3/-32                29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-11-01T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-11-07T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently six numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing solar disk. The recent M-class flaring in the southeast may be attributable to Active Region 13477 (S15E80) and possibly an additional unnumbered region visible in SDO imagery near the eastern limb around latitude S10 and may continue throughout the outlook period. Additional minor flaring activity may occur throughout the outlook period from recently numbered Active Region 13478 (N12E70).\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A prominent coronal hole structure centered around S20E40 but with a portion extending meridionally through the equator to about N20 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective starting on or around 2023-11-07. Additional enhancements in geomagnetic activity may be observed during the outlook period in association with the potential arrival of a C-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-10-31T22:12Z. Additionally, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt remains enhanced at the start of the outlook period (see notifications 20231029-AL-001, 20231029-AL-002, and 20231031-AL-001) and this elevation is likely to persist into the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"Type":"CME","name":"20231101-AL-001","date":"2023-11-01T15:56Z","note":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-11-01T15:56:27Z\n## Message ID: 20231101-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There are currently two numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13468 (currently located around S10W48) produced low level C-class flaring throughout the reporting period and may continue to exhibit flaring activity before rotating off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2023-10-29.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A small coronal hole currently centered around N10W40 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO) may reach geoeffective longitudes on or around 2023-10-27. A coronal hole currently centered around longitude E30 and extending from latitudes S10 to N40 may reach a geoeffective longitude towards the end of the reporting period on or around 2023-10-31.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"Type":"CME","name":"20231025-AL-003","date":"2023-10-25T21:13Z","note":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-10-25T21:13:08Z\n## Message ID: 20231025-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There are currently three numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13464 (currently located at N04W42) exhibited C-class flaring throughout the reporting period and may continue to exhibit flaring activity before it rotates off the Earth-facing disk around 2023-10-22. Additional flaring activity may occur throughout the outlook period from an unnumbered region currently visible in SDO imagery around N25E60.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and below minor levels during the outlook period. A slight increase in geomagnetic activity may be observed around 2023-10-19 in association with the predicted arrival of a C-type CME first observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2023-10-16T12:09Z (see notifications 20231016-AL-002, 20231017-AL-001, and 20231017-AL-002) as previously summarized above. Additionally, a small coronal hole currently centered around N45W20 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO) may reach geoeffective longitudes on or around 2023-10-22. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"Type":"CME","name":"20231018-AL-001","date":"2023-10-18T18:22Z","note":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Solar Orbiter, OSIRIS, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-10-18T18:22:30Z\n## Message ID: 20231018-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
